ABSTRACT 
Climate change may be caused by both natural and anthropogenic forcing, but at present 
time unsustainable anthropogenic activities and enormous greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
emissions are causing erratic climate change. The Earth's average temperature has risen by 
1.5°F over the past century, and is projected to rise another 0.5°F to 8.6°F over the next 
hundred years. Nepal is one of the least developed country in the world and was ranked as 
the 4th most vulnerable country due to the impacts of climate change by Maplecroft in 2010, 
but, in contrary, it is one of the least contributor to global GHGs emissions, emitting 0.027% 
of global total. Lack of adequate fund for adaptation makes Nepal and its people very 
vulnerable to climate change. This study is intended to study the impacts of climate change 
that Nepal might face in future. The study was generally based on the secondary data like 
journal papers, reports and others. Nepal lies in Hindukush Himalaya region and IPCC 4th 
Assessment report suggests region as a “white spot” due to the lack of adequate research. 
Even though compressing limited number of research, climate change is supposed to cause 
enormous negative impacts in this region and Nepal. It was found that the temperature of 
Nepal is warming at the rate faster than that of the global average. Review of many papers 
shows that vulnerability of Nepal may be alleviated by the fact of country’s fragile 
ecosystem, uneven topography, high dependency on agriculture, hydroelectricity and low 
GPD. It was seen that climate impacts many key sectors of Nepal like agriculture, 
hydroelectricity, food security, tourism and many others. Climate change is expected to 
cause many other climate induced hazard like flood, drought, landslides. Thus, these impact 
will directly impacts the economy of the country and hence the livelihood of the people.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report defines climate 
change as a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean 
and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically 
decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external 
forcing such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, and persistent 
anthropogenic changes. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) defines climate change as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or 
indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which 
is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.  
Greenhouse gases is considered as the major force in causing the accelerated climate change. 
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven 
largely by unsustainable anthropocentric activities, and are now higher than ever. Their 
effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers are extremely likely to have been 
the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Earth's average 
temperature has risen by 1.5°F over the past century, and is projected to rise another 0.5 to 
8.6°F over the next hundred years. Small changes in the average temperature of the planet 
can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather (US EPA, n.d.).  
Rising global temperatures cause significant impacts on weather and climate. Many places 
have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as 
some place has witnessed more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and 
glaciers have also experienced the impacts of changing climate; oceans are warming and 
becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea levels are rising. As these and other 
changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges 
to our society and our environment (US EPA, n.d.).

Nexus between climate change and its impacts on Nepal 
Nepal is a land-locked country located in South Asia between India and China, at 28° North 
latitude and 84° east longitude. It has an extremely varied and complex climate, driven by 
the uneven terrain and regional weather systems. Within a few hundred kilometers, the 
country’s elevation changes from the lowland of 70m in the Terai to the top of the world, 
Mount Everest (8,848m). Nepal is considered as one of the top ten countries most likely to 
be impacted by global climate change (WFP, 2009) but is one of the least contributors to the 
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), emits only 0.027% of global share (INDC, 2016). 
Nepal is one of the least developed countries of the world having GDP of mere US $562 
(CBS, 2012) with around 25% of the total population living under poverty line as of US$ 
1.25 a day (NPC, 2010). Nepal economy is highly dependent upon agricultural sector 
(contributes about 38% of the country GDP), and supports more than 70% of the country 
population (CBS, 2012). In addition, Nepal ranks 145 on the Human Development Index. 
All these facts makes Nepal very vulnerable to climate change (INDC, 2016). 
Data on trends of Nepal from 1975 to 2005 showed that temperature rise by 0.06°C annually 
whereas mean rainfall has significantly decreased on an average of 3.7 mm (-3.2%) per 
month per decade. Under various climate change scenarios, mean annual temperatures are 
projected to increase between 1.3-3.8°C by the 2060s and 1.8-5.8°C by the 2090s. Whereas, 
annual precipitation is projected to reduce in a range of 10 to 20% across the country (INDC, 
2016). The temperature in the Himalayas, however, is increasing at a faster rate, and this has 
serious impacts on the country’s glacial lakes (Raut, 2004). According to Nepal’s second 
communication report, 2014; overall seasonal maximum temperature in the country is found 
to have the largest increase of 4.5˚C in spring and smallest increase of 3.3˚C in summer, 
whereas minimum temperature in the country is found to have the largest increase of 5.4˚C 
in winter and smallest increase of 3.4˚C in summer by the end of the 21st century. PRECIS 
projection found that annual precipitation will decrease by 2% of the baseline amount by 
2020s. However, it will increase by 6% and 12% of the baseline by 2050s and 2080s 
(MoSTE, 2014).

Legal framework 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the focal body of 
UN for climate change. Nepal signed the UNFCCC on 12 June 1992; it was ratified on 2 
May, 1994 and entered into force on 31 July, 1994. Nepal’s Ministry of Population and 
Environment (MOPE) is the focal point for the UNFCCC whereby it coordinates climate 
related activities in the country. 
Key Policy Interventions/Submission by Nepal 
• Climate Change Council, 2009, chaired by the Prime Minister 
• Climate Change Management Division, 2010, MoEnv 
• National Adaptation Programme of Action, 2010 
• Climate Change Policy, 2011 
• Climate Resilient Planning Tool , 2011: NPC 
• Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA), November 2011 
• Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, 2016 
• National Adaptation Plans is ongoing 
The Government constituted the Climate Change Council under the chairpersonship of the 
Prime Minister in 2009, endorsed the Climate Change Policy in 2011, adopted the National 
Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 and framework for Local Adaptation 
Plan of Actions in 2011. In 2010 a Climate Change Management Division under the Ministry 
of Environment (currently Ministry of Population and Environment) was established and 
two years later the Climate Change Budget Code was approved.  Adding to this, the National 
Planning Commission prepared a tool for climate resilient planning which mainstreams 
adaptation to climate change into the planning process. 
1.2 Statement of the Problem 
Climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and this is highly impacting people of Nepal 
as well as the economy of the country. Nepal’s low resilient capacity, lack of adequate fund 
for adaptation makes Nepal and its people very vulnerable to climate change. Adding to this, 
it is observed that climate change impacts largely on agriculture, tourism, hydroelectricity, 
economy, livelihood and might cause many climate induced disaster like GLOFs, landslide, 
3 
flood, drought, epidemic. Thus, this study is intended to study the impacts that Nepal might 
face as an effect of climate change in future. This paper might be helpful to develop certain 
remedial plan to adapt or mitigate those situations. 
1.3 Objectives 
General Objective:  
To study the impacts of climate change in Nepal. 
Specific objective: 
• To study the impacts of climate change by sectoral basis in Nepal

CHAPTER II 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This study was generally based on the secondary data. Many journal articles published on 
the international journal, few reports and some authorized web page were critically 
reviewed. Syntheses have been drawn after reviewing those papers in order to document 
nexus and the impacts of climate change in Nepal.  
CHAPTER III 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Impacts of climate change is uncertain. Nepal lies in the central part of Hindukush-Himalaya 
region. IPCC's AR4 designated this region a "white spot" because of the limited scientific 
studies. Meanwhile, the number of researchers we have till now suggests that few positive 
impacts of changing climate might be seen in some places, but, in the long run in most of 
the places, the negative impacts is projected to be dominant. Some of the impacts of climate 
change that Nepal is facing and might be facing in future are discussed below. 
3.1 
Temperature and Precipitation Projections of Nepal 
According to the study done Nepal Climate Vulnerability Study Team (NCVST) 2009, the 
projection of climate change in Nepal is given below: 
• Global circulation model (GCM) projections indicate that the temperature over Nepal 
will increase between 0.5ºC and 2.0ºC with a multi-model mean of 1.4ºC, by the 
2030s and between 3.0ºC and 6.3ºC, with a multi-model mean of 4.70C, by the 2090s. 
GCM outputs suggest that extremely hot days (the hottest 5% of days in the period 
from 1970 to 1999) are projected to increase by up to 55% by the 2060s and up to 
70% by the 2090s. 
• GCM outputs suggest that extremely hot nights (the hottest 5% of nights in the period 
from 1970 to 1999) are projected to increase by up to 77% by the 2060s and 93% by 
the 2090s. 
5 
• GCMs project a wide range of precipitation changes, especially during the monsoon: 
from a decrease of 14% to an increase of 40% by the 2030s and from a decrease of 
52% to an increase of 135% by the 2090s. 
3.2 
Impacts on Agriculture 
The agricultural sector accounts for around three quarters of employment and around one
third of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Nepal. The sector is predominantly made up of 
small-scale farming and much of this is dependent upon monsoon natural rainfall. 
Agriculture is considered extremely sensitive to climate change. Climate change might 
reduce the amount of the desirable crops while on the others hand encourages pest and weed 
proliferation. Agriculture in Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its rugged 
terrain with steep topography, tectonically active geology and related risks of the natural 
disasters. Large proportion of marginal farmers with small landholding, limited irrigation 
availability, low income level, limited institutional capacity, and greater dependency on 
natural resources increase the degree of vulnerability (Regmi and Adhikari, 2007; World 
Bank, 2008).  
Farmers are likely to face three types of costs from climate change, namely, direct impact 
costs, indirect impact costs, and adaptation costs (Pant, 2011). 
• Direct impacts costs includes the cost of effects of climate change on crop 
production, livestock production, and risks of natural hazards. 
• Indirect impacts costs includes the cost of effect of climate change on socioeconomic 
conditions and lost opportunities. 
• Adaptation costs includes the cost incurred to keep themselves away from or 
minimize the negative effects of climate change. 
A number of additional potential effects from climate change are highlighted, including 
higher flood risks, enhanced soil erosion and changes in the range/prevalence of pests and 
diseases – these would all be likely to increase impacts to the agricultural sector (IDS-Nepal 
et al., 2014). Study shows that increase in temperature has positive impacts on the production 
of rice. According to MoPE, 2004; rice production may increase by 0.09% to 7% in the case 
when temperature is increased up to 4°C and precipitation is increased by 20%. The analysis 
6 
found potentially high impacts in the Terai region, especially for rice and wheat production, 
but a varied pattern in the hills and mountains. Assuming that the projected loss of rice and 
wheat yields in Terai region, the climate change is likely to reduce food production in Nepal. 
Everything else remaining the same, the national loss in food production is expected to be 
5.3% in 2020s, 3.5% in 2050s and 12.1% in 2080s. The loss of food grain thus accounts to 
435 thousand metric tons in 2020s, 302 thousand metric tons in 2050s and 1040 thousand 
metric tons in 2080s. By the 2070s, net agricultural losses in Nepal are estimated to be the 
equivalent per year of around 0.8% of current GDP, or US$140 million/year in current 
prices. The impacts will be much more severe in years of extreme rainfall variability. 
However, it is to be noted that increase in maximum temperature different effect in 
mountainous region than that of Terai (IDS Nepal et al, 2014). 
On the other hand climate change is making the situation of the food security even worse. 
Climate change have affected production, processing, consumption and distribution of food 
either directly or indirectly. Thus, plays a significant role in the alteration of the personal 
hygiene and human health by increased activities of the pathogens (Pant, 2012). 
3.3 
Impacts on Livestock Production 
There is a growing concern on the effects of climate change on livestock production. Climate 
change can have positive as well as negative impacts on livestock production. On positive 
aspect, rise in temperature may result into more greenery and pasture land, benefiting 
livestock production in high mountains. However, opinions are divided. Several studies (e.g. 
Kabubo-Mariara, 2009, Hertel and Rosch, 2010) show that climate change adversely affects 
livestock and poultry production. Kabubo-Mariara (2009) argues that livestock production 
is highly sensitive to climate change. 
Climate change also increases mortality and morbidity of animals particularly from the 
climate sensitive infectious diseases (Patz et al., 2005b). Increases in zoonotic diseases 
among the animals also increase the risks of transmission of such diseases in human beings. 
Increased temperature and relative humidity is said to increase the risks of aflatoxin 
development in feedstuffs whereby increasing the risks of poisoning among animals (Pant, 
2011). Moreover, it is said that climate change increases the costs of veterinary medicines 
7 
in livestock and poultry production. In summary, as a result of climate change, Nepalese 
farmers have to bear loss from the livestock production. 
3.4 
Impacts on Hydroelectricity 
Water is critical for Nepal’s power production as hydroelectric plants provide around 90% 
of total electricity (IDS-Nepal, 2014). Rainfall has a major influence on electricity 
generation. During the dry season, river flows are insufficient to operate all plants, which 
results in high levels of planned interruptions. An analysis of the impact of climate variability 
on electricity production (and the impact of planned interruptions) indicates that economic 
costs could be equivalent to 0.1% of GDP per year on average, and 0.3% in very dry years. 
On the other hands, hydroelectric plants are also subject to the risks of floods including, 
GLOFs in some locations. For example a multi-million dollar hydropower facility was lost 
in 1985 due to a GLOF event and there have been more recent losses of micro hydro plants 
from floods (IDS Nepal et al., 2014). 
Thus, for the country like Nepal which is highly dependent on the hydroelectricity for power 
generation, climate change is considered as curse in the long run. Many reports says that, 
due to glacier melting the discharge in the river will increase for certain period of time and 
that particular  time might be fruitful for the electricity generation. But, if we consider long 
run, water discharge level is supposed to decrease after 2050, thus it will be hard for Nepal 
to extract high amount of electricity from running water. Many other climate induced 
disaster like GLOF, flood, drought, landslides, erosions are also supposed to cause negative 
impacts on hydroelectricity generation (IDS Nepal et al., 2014).  
3.5 
Impacts on Livelihood 
Climate change impacts will affect Nepal through a number of pathways, including disasters, 
hydropower, irrigation, and domestic water usage. This might lead to the change in 
livelihood of people. Some people migrate to other place for better livelihood. While some 
others might change their habits to adapt to the changing climate, some people have changed 
their cropping systems or patterns. Few case studies done by IDS Nepal shows that, there is 
increase in the frequency of occurrence of hailstorm in Kaski district while on the other hand, 
west Rapti river side have witness high number of floods in last decade. Meanwhile, in 
Mustang a decline in the productivity of buckwheat over the last decade was seen. The above 
8 
three case studies from different part of Nepal can be an example on how climate change is 
affecting different communities of the country. Nepal has suffered from the impacts of 
increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as landslides, floods and droughts 
resulting in the loss of human lives as well as high economic costs and social disputes. The 
way of living has been changed by the impacts of climate change. 
About 1/3rd of working force of Nepal is dependent upon agriculture as their major 
occupation to sustain their livelihood. But as discussed above agriculture is very sensitive to 
climate change. The negative impacts of climate change on agriculture might largely affect 
the economy and hence the livelihood of the people. Many people are also dependent upon 
tourism sector to sustain their livelihood, but for mountainous country like Nepal, climate 
change might cause many adverse impacts in tourism sector which might ultimately affect 
the livelihood of the people who are dependent upon the tourism sector to sustain their 
livelihood. 
3.6 
Impacts on Economy 
Current climate variability and extreme events lead to major economic costs in Nepal. These 
are dominated by floods, soil erosion, droughts but also include rainfall variability on 
agriculture. Low seasonal river flows reduces hydroelectricity generation which impacts 
greatly on country’s economy. The 2013 study on Economic Impact Assessment of Climate 
Change in Key Sectors (agriculture, hydropower and water-induced disasters) has estimated 
direct cost of current climate variability and extreme events equivalent to 1.5 to 2% of 
current GDP per year (approximately USD 270-360 million per year in 2013 prices) and 
much higher in extreme years, rising to 5% or more. This is high by international levels 
(IDS-Nepal et al., 2014). An indicative analysis of the impacts of climate change on water
induced disasters at the national level estimates that the additional average expected annual 
direct cost could be equivalent to 1.1% per year of current GDP by mid-century, with an 
upper estimate of almost 3% per year.  
3.7 
Climate Induced Disasters 
Climate change not only affects agriculture, livestock, tourism, hydroelectricity, livelihood 
and economy. It is supposed to affect almost every sector and people from every walk of the 
life, either directly or indirectly. Besides direct impacts of direct of climate change there is 
9 
many other indirect impacts of climate change that might affect Nepal and its people 
severely. Climate induced disaster and their further consequences can be as the indirect 
effect of climate. Some of the disaster that can be triggered by climate change is discussed 
below. 
Flood: 
Floods in Nepal are particularly associated with summer monsoon rains, and are a feature of 
current climate variability. The country's more than 6,000 rivers and rivulets, with a total of 
45,000 km in length, support irrigated agriculture and other livelihoods, but also wreak 
havoc in valleys and in the Terai when they overflow. For example the Koshi embankment 
breach flood caused by institutional dysfunction affected 3.5 million people in Nepal and 
India (Dixit, 2009: Shrestha et al, 2010). At the same time, the return period of a flood of a 
certain magnitude is found to reduce significantly,  such that the flow associated with a 1
in-10 year event could happen every few years under climate change, and a 1-in-100 year 
event could occur every few decades (IDS-Nepal et al., 2014). In most cases, climate change 
is projected to increase the intensity and frequency of high flows, and increase flood risks in 
Nepal. Flood inundation is the major climate-related hazard in the country, affecting 
property, agriculture, infrastructure (roads, bridges, communications and transmission 
networks), business and commerce and, at worst, causing loss of life. Each major flood costs 
the average household the equivalent of US$9,000. In a desperately poor country such as 
Nepal, where average household annual income in 2011 was US$2,700 (using 2011 
exchange rates), these floods are a huge financial burden. The floods also bring water-borne 
diseases such as cholera and typhoid, putting lives at risk. This story is replicated across 
Nepal. Between 1983 and 2010, floods have every year on average resulted in 283 deaths, 
8000 homes destroyed and 29,000 families affected (CDKN, 2014). There are also additional 
risks from Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) which can impact on communities and 
infrastructure for considerable distances downstream. Geo-scientist have predicted that 4 
degree Celsius increase in temperature could wipe out 70% of snow and glaciers and this 
eventually resulting in GLOF. INDC of Nepal, 2016 stated that, in Nepal’s Himalaya, total 
estimated ice reserve between 1977 and 2010 decreased by 29% (129 km3). The number of 
glacier lakes increased by 11% and glaciers recede on an average by 38 km2 per year during 
10 
the same period. Hence, climate change has visible and pronounced impacts on snows and 
glaciers that are likely to increase the possibilities of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods. 
Landslides: 
It is another climate induced hazard which are often related to extreme rainfall or flood 
events. Landslides also have significant impacts on communities and infrastructure. Nepal 
is a country of uneven terrain and people of hills and mountainous region are consider to be 
vulnerable to landslides. Occurrence of landslides can be triggered by high precipitation 
hence climate change can be significant role in increase the frequency of the precipitation 
and hence the landslide. 
Drought: 
Due to climate change some part of the country might get excessive amount of rain while 
other part might suffer from drought. Increasing temperature might trigger drought event. 
Climate dynamics suggest that agriculture in Nepal will face immense challenges as seasonal 
drought increases. The impact of the 2008-2009 winter droughts on farming and on local 
food security was severe.  In that period, most monitoring stations received less than 50% of 
normal rainfall, 30% recorded no precipitation at all and temperatures were 1-2°C above 
average. At the national level, wheat and barley production decreased by 14.5% and 17.3% 
respectively and the 2009 maize production was also seriously affected. At present, 40 
districts, mostly in the West, face major food deficits. The increase in the frequency in the 
occurrence of the drought event will effect severely in agricultural sector. Thus, Nepal, a 
country with its 1/3rd of working force dependent upon agriculture to sustain their livelihood 
will be severely impacted. 
Forest fire: 
An increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts, if coupled with extended forest cover, 
will greatly increase the risk of forest fires. These fires not only had a negative impact locally 
but have other indirect long-term impacts, too. The loss of forest implies loss of local 
livelihoods. It may also affect integrity of local water sources. Biodiversity also will be 
severely impacted by forest fire and changing climate.

Besides these there are many other climate induced hazards whose frequency might be 
enhanced if the climate continues to change abruptly. National Adaptation Programme of 
Action (NAPA) 2010, ranked 29 districts as highly vulnerable to landslides, 22 districts to 
drought, 12 districts to GLOFs, and 9 districts to flooding.

CHAPTER IV 
CONCLUSION 
Overall, it can be concluded that climate change and Nepal have a nexus between each other. 
It was found that the temperature of Nepal is warming at the faster than that of the global 
average. Review of many papers shows that Nepal is very vulnerable to climate change and 
this problem may be alleviate low resilient capacity. It was seen that climate impacts many 
sectors. Few sectors in which GDP of the country is highly dependent is also impacted by 
climate change. For example agriculture, hydroelectricity. Climate change is expected to 
cause many other climate induced hazard like flood, drought, landslides, forest fire etc. with 
it. Climate change thus directly impacts the economy of the country and hence the livelihood 
of the people.
