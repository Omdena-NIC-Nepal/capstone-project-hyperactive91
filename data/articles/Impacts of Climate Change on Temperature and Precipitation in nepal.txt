Abstract: Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on Nepal, affecting its infrastructure, agriculture, and water 
resources. This study created day-to-day bias-corrected data of precipitation (ppt), maximum temperature (tmax) and 
minimum temperature (tmin) at 0.25° spatial resolution for Nepal using 7 CMIP6-GCMs under two shared socioeconomic 
pathways, SSP245 and SSP585. The bias-corrected datasets were produced using an empirical robust quantile mapping 
method for ppt and quantile mapping with linear transformation function method for tmax and tmin. The bias-corrected dataset 
was evaluated by comparing it against observed data for the mean values of ppt, tmax and tmin. Our bias-corrected projections 
reveal a warming of 4-6°C and an increase in ppt of 40-60% by the end of the 21st century. These changes will have a 
significant impact on Nepal's climate, environment, and people. The bias-corrected projections can be used to assess the 
impact of climate change in Nepal and to develop adaptation strategies.

1. Introduction 
Climate change is a result of the air's ozone harming 
substance groupings of CO2 and other ozone harming 
substances increasing exponentially (Malla, 2008). It 
poses a critical global challenge, affecting ecosystems, 
economies, and the livelihoods of millions. In this context, 
understanding the impacts of climate change at regional 
levels becomes paramount. This study explores the 
specific case of Nepal, a nation with unique geographical 
diversity and a pronounced vulnerability to climate 
change. As per projections, climate change will influence 
the quality and quantity of water in the future (Pandey et 
al., 2020). Lately climate change in Nepal has brought a 
quick rise in temperature, an unpredictable pattern of ppt, 
a more limited winter, and more frequent and prolonged 
droughts (Palazzoli et al., 2015). So, accurate projections 
for this region are essential for informed decision-making 
and mitigation efforts. 
Nepal's geography is diverse, ranging from lowlands in 
the south to towering Himalayan peaks in the north 
(Shrestha et al., 2016). It is also a country with a high 
level of biodiversity and one of the nations that are acutely 
responsive and exposed to the consequences of climate 
change. As a result of global warming, Nepal has seen an 
increase in hydrometeorological extremes, a shift in the 
pattern of ppt, and a rapid rise in temperature 
(Talchabhadel and Karki, 2019). Nepalese environmental 
change research predicts that temperature is supposed to 
rise steadily all throughout the 21st century (Shrestha et 
al., 2016). The average annual temperature in Nepal is 
expected to ascend by 1.2°C, 1.7°C, and 3°C from the 
benchmark time of 1961–1990 in 2030, 2050, and 2100, 
respectively, as per research by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
Comparative projections for annual precipitation for the 
same time periods incorporate increments of 5, 7, and 
12% (Khadka and Pathak, 2016). Such changes affect 
diverse sectors, including agriculture, public health, and 
the sustainability of mountain ecosystems (Malla, 2008). 
To understand the complex interplay of climate factors 
in Nepal, we rely on General Circulation Models (GCMs), 
which are mathematical models that simulate the 
circulation of the Earth's atmosphere, providing insights 
into past, present, and future climate trends (Christensen et 
al., 2008; Y. Mishra et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2020). 
However, these models often work at spatial resolutions

Impacts of Climate Change on Temperature and Precipitation in Nepal: Projections and Bias Correction 
that are insufficient for precise regional assessments, and 
they may contain biases in temperature and precipitation 
(Christensen et al., 2008; Mishra et al., 2018; Mishra et 
al., 2020; Timilsina et al., 2021). Thus, to produce reliable 
assessments of climate change and its impacts, the 
application of bias correction techniques becomes 
imperative (Christensen et al., 2008; Mishra et al., 2020). 
The primary objective of this study is to generate 
accurate projections of daily ppt, tmax and tmin for Nepal. 
Using information from seven different CMIP6-GCMs, 
we employ advanced bias correction techniques (quantile 
mapping with a linear transformation function and 
empirical robust quantile mapping) to refine these 
projections. By evaluating historical data and examining 
future scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585), our research seeks 
to shed light on Nepal's climate change projections across 
its varied landscapes, spanning the near future (NF) 
(2023-2048), mid future (MF) (2049-2074), and far future 
(FF) (2075-2100). These findings are vital not only for 
policymakers, but also for stakeholders engaged in 
crafting strategies to address Nepal's evolving climate and 
precipitation patterns. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Study area 
Our study focuses on Nepal, a landlocked country 
located in South Asia, covering a total area of 147,516 
square kilometers. Nepal's geographic coordinates extend 
from approximately 26°22' to 36°27' latitude and 80°4' to 
88°12' longitude (Devkota et al., 2006). Nepal's 
topography is characterized by remarkable variation, 
primarily categorized into three distinct regions: the Terai 
region, which comprises the lowlands and lies at 
elevations below 610 meters; the Hilly region, 
characterized by elevations ranging from 610 meters to 
4,877 meters; and the Himalayan region, which includes 
the towering peaks of Nepal, reaching elevations from 
4,877 meters to the country's highest point at 8,848 meters 
above sea level (Devkota et al., 2006). The nation is 
primarily drained by three major river basins: the Koshi, 
Narayani, and Karnali. These river basins, in turn, 
contribute to the larger Ganges River basin (Devkota et 
al., 2006). The map of the study area is shown in figure 
below.

2.2. Data sources 
Temperature and precipitation Data 
To ensure the reliability of our historical temperature 
data, we gathered observed daily ppt, tmax and tmin 
records from a network of 216 weather stations spanning 
Nepal. These observations cover the period from 1980 to 
2014 and were originally compiled by Sheffield et al. in 
2006 (Sheffield et al., 2006). Additionally, we acquired 
data for 18 specific stations located within the Narayani 
River basin from the Department of Hydrology and 
Meteorology (DHM). We also gathered data from 18 
specific weather stations situated within the Narayani 
River basin. To make sure this data was reliable, we 
carefully compared it to Sheffield's dataset. We found that 
the two datasets matched quite closely. Further, another 
study by (Shah et al., 2016) also confirmed that Sheffield's 
dataset aligns well with weather station data across South 
Asia. Considering the sparse distribution of weather 
stations, particularly within the challenging terrain of the 
Himalayan region, and recognizing gaps in observational 
data, we concluded that employing the dataset from 
(Sheffield et al., 2006) as our observational reference was 
the most prudent choice for this research. 
GCMs (CMIP6) data 
This study used historical (1980-2014) data and future 
(2015-2100) projections of CMIP6 GCMs for all three 
variables: ppt, tmax and tmin. The temperatures and 
precipitation variables are established based on two 
scenarios i.e, SSP245 and SSP585.  The scenarios used in 
the CMIP6 combine Share Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 
and aim for a specific level of radioactive forcing by the 
end of the 21st century. SSP245 is based on the 
socioeconomic pathway (SSP-2) with the target 
radioactive level of 4.5 W/m² (Gidden et al., 2019) and 
SSP585 is based on emission scenarios SSP-5 and 
radioactive level of 8.5 W/m² (Gidden et al., 2019; V. 
Mishra et al., 2020). The CMIP6 projections exhibit 
improved accuracy for ppt and temperature uncertainties 
compared to CMIP5 (Hamed et al., 2022). We chose 7 
CMIP6-GCMs to obtain raw daily ppt, tmax and tmin from 
https://nex-gddp-cmip6.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/.  
Incorporating multiple GCMs helps to mitigate the 
inherent biases present in the GCMs. 
The overall methodology of this study is shown in 
Figure 2. The major activities involved are: 
Acquisition of data: The observed data and GCMs data 
set were acquired. The observed data consisted of daily 
ppt, tmax and tmin of 216 stations all across Nepal at the 
spatial resolution of 0.25° for the period of 1980 to 2014. 
The GCMs data consisted of historical (1980-2014) and 
future (2015-2100) projections of temperature and 
precipitation for seven CMIP6-GCMs.

GCMs Selection  
 
We chose seven CMIP6 General Circulation Models 
(GCMs) for ppt, tmax and tmin. Multiple GCMs helps us 
reduce uncertainties that can be inherent in these models. 
Seven GCMs were deemed sufficient to start with. Our 
selection of these seven GCMs was based on their ability 
to provide daily tmax, tmin and ppt data for historical 
periods as well as two future scenarios, SSP245 and 
SSP585 under r1i1p1f1 initial conditions. They have also 
been widely used in climate change studies for the South 
Asian region (V. Mishra et al., 2020). To assess how well 
these GCMs performed, we used historical observed 
monthly mean tmax, tmin and ppt data from the period 
1980 to 2014 as a reference. This allowed us to evaluate 
the accuracy of the GCMs in representing real-world 
climate conditions. Here's a table showing which different 
CMIP6 models we used in our study:

SSP selection 
 
In our research, we specifically chose to focus on two 
climate scenarios, SSP245 and SSP585, because they 
represent contrasting pathways for our planet's future. 
SSP245, resembling a more cautious approach, targets a 
moderate environmental impact with a radiative forcing 
goal of 4.5 W/m² by the century's end (Gidden et al., 
2019). On the other hand, SSP585 represents a less 
cautious scenario with a higher radiative forcing target of 
8.5 W/m² by the end of the century (Gidden et al., 2019; 
Mishra et al., 2020). By studying these two scenarios, we 
aim to understand and compare the potential climate 
outcomes for Nepal under different levels of 
environmental concern and action. 
 
Bias correction methods 
 
Uncertainties in the climate model make it challenging 
to predict future climate accurately, so to address this 
issue, bias correction is employed (Muerth et al., 2013). 
For modifying RCM output, bias correction processes use 
a transformation algorithm. The primary objective is to 
identify any biases between observed and simulated 
climatic variables. These corrected output will serve as the 
foundation for both control and scenario RCM runs 
(Teutschbein and Seibert, 2012). Several bias correction 
methods have been developed for precipitation and 
temperature (Gudmundsson et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2018; 
Timilsina et al., 2021). Precipitation correction methods 
includes Daily Bias Correction (DBC), Quantile Mapping, 
Local Intensity Scaling (LOCI), Distribution Mapping 
(DM), LS and PT. Similarly, DM, DT, EQM, LS, quantile 
mapping (QM), multiple regression and gamma-gamma 
transformation are used for temperature correction 
(Gudmundsson et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2018). For this 
study, we used quantile mapping tools. Numerous 
Impacts of Climate Change on Temperature and Precipitation in Nepal: Projections and Bias Correction 
researches identify the quantile mapping tools are the most 
effective tools in removing biases. (Teutschbein and 
Seibert, 2012; Zollo et al., 2014; V. Mishra et al., 2020). 
We implement Empirical Robust Quantile mapping 
technique for bias correction of historical (1980-2014) for 
precipitation using data by Sheffield et al.  This approach 
extends the empirical quantile mapping method by using 
non-linear local linear least square (NLLS) regression to 
establish a quantile-quantile link between historical 
observed and modelled time series data. The quantile 
mapping method provides robust framework for correcting 
biases and enhancing the reliability of climate projection. 
The estimation of a flexible quantile mapping function g() 
such that F-1(τ)=g[F-1(τ)] is done using NLLS based on 
the ten closest data points indicated in the quantile
quantile plot for each quantile level τ = 0, 0.01, 0.02,….., 
0.99, 1.0. The future projection at time ‘t’ is then derived 
through the expression: 
x(t)=g[x(t) (Qian and Chang, 2021). 
For temperature bias correction, the Linear 
transformation function is employed. According to 
(Timilsina et al., 2021) linear transformation function 
shows better performance than other methods, so we 
choose it as a best performing bias correction method for 
temperature. The Linear QM framework assumes a linear 
connection between quantile functions of observed values 
and the model over the historical period. Mathematically, 
this relationship us expressed as,  
F-1(τ) = a + b*F-1(τ), 
Where coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ are derived through a 
linear least square regression. Consequently, bias 
corrected future projections at time ‘t’ are calculated as, 
x(t) = a + b*x(t). 
Challenges  
Obtaining accurate and reliable historical climate data for 
bias correction across Nepal posed a considerable 
challenge, particularly in remote and higher Himalayan 
regions. In particular, we encountered gaps in the daily 
data from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology 
(DHM) for the Narayani River basin for the years 
spanning from 1980 to 2014. To address these gaps, we 
used average data of each month over the long period. 
Additionally, to ensure data accuracy, we meticulously 
cross-verified Sheffield's dataset with DHM's data. This 
was done to guarantee the reliability and consistency of 
the climate data we used for our research. Furthermore, 
managing extensive datasets and handling complex 
computations throughout the research process presented 
significant hurdles. These challenges are inherent in 
climate research, but require careful attention and 
resources to navigate effectively. 
3. Results 
We began by examining how ppt, tmax and tmin might 
change in the future. We used data from seven different 
climate 
models (CMIP6-GCMs) to make these 
predictions. We looked at two different scenarios, SSP245 
and SSP585, and divided the future into three timeframes: 
NF, MF and FF. We compared these future projections to 
the past, specifically from 1989 to 2014. The combined 
results from all the models suggest that annual ppt in 
Nepal could increase by about 40-60% in the later part of 
the 21st century, especially under the SSP585 scenario. 
How much the rain increases, along with how hot it gets, 
depends on the scenario. For example, in the Far Future, 
under SSP245, tmin might go up by around 2°C. 
However, under SSP585, the increase could be as much as 
4°C. Similarly, tmax could rise by about 2-4°C by the end 
of the 21st century. Figure 3 below shows the change in 
more detail.

mean annual tmax. Median of all three variables is shown 
in each panel.  
We started with raw climate data for ppt, tmax, and 
tmin. This data was essential for understanding how 
Nepal's climate might change in different future scenarios. 
However, this raw data has some inaccuracies, so we 
needed to remove inherent biases. Bias correction helps 
make the data more accurate, especially at the local level. 
We did this correction for both the past (1980-2014) and 
the future (2015-2100) under two different scenarios: 
SSP245 and SSP585. After correcting the data, we 
estimated the multi-model ensemble mean bias in ppt,

Impacts of Climate Change on Temperature and Precipitation in Nepal: Projections and Bias Correction  
tmax and tmin from all 7 CMIP6-GCMs (Fig. 4). The bias 
was compared against observed data from Sheffield et al. 
(2006). Before the correction, we noticed that the raw data 
tended to overestimate ppt in most of Nepal (Fig. 4a). On 
the other hand, it underestimated both tmax and tmin in 
many areas (Fig. 4c, f). After applying bias-correction 
methods, the bias was eliminated to some extent in all 
three variables (mean annual ppt, tmax and tmin) (Fig. 4b, 
d, f). 
Figure 4: MME mean bias in ppt, tmax and tmin in 7 
CMIP6-GCMs. (a-b) Bias (%) in mean annual ppt for the 
historical period (1985-2014) before and after the bias 
correction, (c,d) Bias (°C) in mean annual tmin before and 
after bias correction, and (e,f) bias (°C) in mean annual 
tmax before and after bias correction. 
After that, when we corrected the ppt data for three 
aforementioned future time period, we found that it still 
showed similar patterns to the raw data from the climate 
models (Fig. 3). This means that both the raw and 
corrected data indicate that southwestern Nepal will likely 
see a significant increase in annual ppt, with the Terai 
region being the most affected. Under SSP585, the 
increase in ppt is even more pronounced compared to 
SSP245 (Fig. 5a-f). For temperature, we found that annual 
mean tmin is expected to rise by about 2.84°C under 
SSP245 and 5.42°C under SSP585 (Fig. 5g-l). Similarly, 
annual mean tmax is expected to increase significantly, 
with SSP585 predicting a median increase of more than 
4.8°C across Nepal (Fig. 5m-r).

tmax. Median of the MME mean ppt, tmax and tmin are 
shown in each panel. Projected changes were estimated 
for the two scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585) against the 
historical period. 
We calculated month-wise multi-model ensemble mean 
of bias-corrected ppt, tmax and tmin from the CMIP6
GCMs for the period of 1985-2014. Then, we compared 
these corrected values ppt, tmax and tmin with 
observations from the same time period. What we found is 
that the patterns of monthly ppt, tmax and exhibit similar 
patterns to the observed dataset (Fig. 6).

The shaded area represents the level of uncertainty, which 
has been estimated using one standard deviation, based on 
7 CMIP6-GCMs. 
For further analysis, we used a 30-year window to 
analyze data for different parts of the country. We focused 
on the most concerning scenario, SSP585, which 
represents the worst-case situation. We looked at each 30
year period, starting from 1986-2015 and continuing 
through to 2100, comparing it to the reference period of 
1985-2014. This allowed us to estimate how things might 
change over time. Our findings indicate that across all 
regions of Nepal, we can expect an increase in average 
annual ppt in the future. By the end of the 21st century, 
this increase could be substantial, ranging from 40-60%. 
However, it's important to note that there is more 
uncertainty in the projections for the Terai region 
compared to other parts of Nepal. On the other hand, the 
uncertainty in projections for tmax and tmin is much 
lower than that of ppt. We anticipate that both tmax and 
tmin could rise significantly, by around 4-6°C, in the far 
future. These changes in temperature and ppt have

We looked at how three important climate factors - ppt, 
tmax and tmin - are expected to change in different 
regions of Nepal over time. We compared these future 
projections with the past to understand the changes better. 
In the NF, under the SSP245 scenario, we expect an 
increase in annual ppt of about 10-21%. The Terai region 
will see the most significant increase, while the Mountain 
region will have the smallest rise. In the FF, ppt is 
projected to increase significantly in all regions of Nepal, 
by around 40-60% (Table 2). When it comes to 
temperature, we anticipate a noticeable difference between 
the NF and FF. In the NF, under SSP245, tmax may rise 
by 0.62-1.27°C (Table 3), while tmin could go up by 1.05
1.47°C (Table 4). However, in the FF under SSP585, the 
increase in tmax could be as high as 4.4-5.21°C, and 
minimum tmin may rise by 5.15-6.16°C. We also 
calculated the standard deviation to understand the level of 
uncertainty in these projections for each region and time 
period under both scenarios.

4. Discussion 
The results obtained from 7 CMIP6-GCMs provide 
valuable information about the projected changes in ppt, 
tmax and tmin in Nepal under different scenarios 
(SSP245, SSP585) and different time periods (NF, MF 
and FF). Based on bias corrected ppt projection, the Terai 
region is expected to have highest increase in ppt, while 
the Mountain region has the smallest increase in ppt 
(Table 2).  Under SSP585 scenario across all the regions 
of Nepal, there will be substantial (40-60%) increase in 
ppt in late 21st century, whereas in the case SSP245 
scenario, there will be less increase in ppt. This finding 
shows a line with global change pattern, which indicates a 
shift towards wetter condition in different geographical 
regions of Nepal in the 21¬-st century. In the case of tmax 
and tmin, this study showed increasing trend in 
temperature in Nepal throughout the 21st century (Figure 
4). The bias corrected MME annual tmax and tmin are 
projected to rise by 4-6°C the end of 21st century (Figure 
6). This indicates that there will be hotter climatic 
condition in future in Nepal. 
 
Implications 
 
The projected alterations in precipitation and 
temperature are poised to have far-reaching consequences 
across numerous sectors in Nepal, including agriculture, 
water resources, and infrastructure. The anticipated 
increase in ppt is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it 
can be beneficial for agriculture by providing more water 
for crops. However, it also elevates the risk of floods, 
landslides, and soil erosion, which could harm both 
agricultural activities and infrastructure (Karki et al., 
2012). The rise in temperature, on the other hand, presents 
challenges for agriculture. It's expected to bring about 
increased evaporation rates, greater water stress, and 
alterations in crop growth patterns. These negative effects 
are likely to be most pronounced in the mountainous and 
hilly regions of Nepal, where agriculture plays a crucial 
role in livelihoods.  
Additionally, the projected increase in ppt has 
implications for Nepal's water resources. It could lead to 
higher runoff, potentially causing flooding in certain 
areas. Conversely, the increased evaporation rates might 
Impacts of Climate Change on Temperature and Precipitation in Nepal: Projections and Bias Correction 
result in water shortages in other regions. These changes 
could significantly affect access to water for various 
purposes, including drinking, irrigation, and hydropower 
generation. Furthermore, the heightened risk of flooding 
and landslides poses a threat to infrastructure elements 
such as roads, bridges, and related constructions. These 
challenges underscore the importance of proactive 
planning and adaptation measures to address the potential 
impacts on these critical sectors. 
Policy and adaptation implications 
The findings of this study carry significant implications 
for policy formulation and adaptation strategies in Nepal, 
especially in the context of climate change. As noted by 
Timilsina et al. (2021), even modest increases in 
temperature can usher in substantial shifts in climate 
patterns. Consequently, this study underscores the urgent 
need for timely policy development and proactive 
adaptation measures to mitigate the potentially severe 
impacts of evolving climatic conditions. 
Nepal's government stands at a critical stage where it 
must proactively address the challenges posed by climate 
change. Policymakers are urged to prioritize the 
development of comprehensive policies and strategies 
designed to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change 
on key sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and 
infrastructure. These policies should be rooted in a holistic 
approach, encompassing both mitigation and adaptation 
measures. 
Effective policies should prioritize the enhancement of 
sectoral resilience to climate change impacts. For 
agriculture, this could entail investments in improved 
irrigation infrastructure, sustainable farming practices, and 
diversification of crops to adapt to changing conditions. 
Likewise, measures to conserve water resources and 
manage them more efficiently will be crucial for ensuring 
continued access to water for various purposes, including 
drinking and irrigation. 
In light of the increased risk of flooding and landslides, 
the establishment of robust early warning systems is 
imperative. These systems should be region-specific and 
capable of delivering timely alerts to vulnerable 
communities. Adequate preparedness and response 
mechanisms must also be in place to minimize casualties 
and damages. 
In summary, the study's findings accentuate the urgency 
for Nepal to take proactive steps in aligning its policies 
and adaptive strategies with the evolving climate. Timely 
and well-informed action can help mitigate the potential 
adverse consequences on agriculture, water resources, and 
infrastructure, ultimately contributing to the resilience and 
sustainable development of the nation in the face of a 
changing climate. 
Comparative analysis 
Our study shows a significant increase in mean annual 
ppt, particularly in the Karnali (Western Region). This 
aligns with the findings of Chapagain et al. (2021), which 
also projected higher yearly ppt in the Karnali region. This 
consistency in results suggests a similar trend in different 
studies, emphasizing the reliability of our findings. Karki 
et al. (2012) previously reported that climate change 
would lead to higher temperatures in Nepal. Our study's 
projections also confirm this trend. Moreover, when 
comparing the SSP585 scenario with the SSP245 scenario, 
our research reveals that the annual increase in tmax and 
tmin is projected to nearly double in all geographical 
regions of Nepal by the end of the 21st century (see Table 
3 and Table 4). This highlights the increasing challenges 
related to rising temperatures. 
Addressing uncertainties 
It's essential to acknowledge that uncertainties still 
exist, as is common in climate research. While our bias 
correction method enhances the reliability of our 
projections, the inherent uncertainties in General 
Circulation Models (GCMs) persist (Moghim et al., 2017). 
We mitigated some uncertainties by using multiple 
models, but there may still be some associated with the 
specific models we selected (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007). 
Additionally, the coarse resolution of GCMs limits their 
ability to provide detailed spatial information. Nepal's 
diverse topography demands higher-resolution data to 
accurately capture local climate variations. 
5. Conclusion 
The projected climate data obtained by using 7 CMIP6
GCMs predict warmer and wetter climatic conditions in 
Nepal for two emission scenarios i.e., SSP245 and 
SSP585, adopting quantile mapping (QM) for bias 
correction. Ppt, tmax and tmin data were projected based 
on different time periods (NF, MF and FF) under two 
scenarios. The findings suggest that there is significant 
increase in ppt by 40-60% and warming trend of 
temperature with projected rise 4-60C at the end of 21st 
century. Across three geographical regions of Nepal, Terai 
region is projected to have higher ppt than other regions. 
In both raw and bias-corrected dataset, there was a 
significant rise in mean annual ppt in the southwestern 
parts of Nepal. Under SSP585 scenario, it is predicted that 
the ensemble mean tmax is going to upsurge remarkably 
all over Nepal. Rising temperature and increase in ppt will 
affect the water resources availability. Projected dataset of 
ppt, t¬¬max and t¬min have notable implication for 
infrastructure 
planning, resource management and 
livelihood of the people in Nepal. Bias-corrected 
projection provide better understanding for the lawmakers 
to understand the potential impacts of climate change and 
to formulate mitigating strategies to reduce possible 
effects.
