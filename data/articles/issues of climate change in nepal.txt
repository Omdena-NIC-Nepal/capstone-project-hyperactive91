1. Introduction
Climate change refers to significant and long-term alterations in the Earth's climate patterns,
predominantly caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial
processes (Climate Action, 2023). These activities release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere, which trap heat and result in
the warming of the planet. While natural factors also influence climate, the current rate of change
far exceeds natural variations and is primarily attributed to human actions (Matoset al., 2022).
The effects of climate change are widespread and multifaceted, impacting various aspects of the
environment, society, and economy. Rising global temperatures lead to more frequent and severe
weather events, including heatwaves, storms, floods, and droughts. These extreme weather events
can devastate communities, disrupt ecosystems, and threaten food and water security (Watts, 2023).
Additionally, melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to sea-level rise, posing risks to coastal cities
and island nations. Ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of excess CO2, harms marine life
and coral reefs, which are crucial ecosystems supporting biodiversity and fisheries (Watts, 2023).
Climate change also exacerbates existing environmental challenges, such as deforestation, habitat
loss, and species extinction. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns alter ecosystems,
disrupting the balance of plant and animal species and leading to shifts in habitats and migration
patterns (Irfan, 2024).

Furthermore, climate change has profound social and economic implications, disproportionately
affecting vulnerable populations, including the poor, elderly, and marginalized communities. It
exacerbates poverty, increases the risk of conflict over dwindling resources, and threatens livelihoods
in sectors like agriculture, fishing, and tourism (Malhi et al., 2021). Addressing climate change
requires concerted efforts at local, national, and international levels, including mitigation strategies
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to cope with its impacts (Kaczan &
Meyer, 2020). Transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting
forests, and promoting sustainable practices are critical steps towards building a more resilient and
sustainable future for generations to come (Perera et al., 2021).
Climate Change in Nepal
Nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, Nepal is a country with rich biodiversity and stunning
landscapes, yet it faces significant challenges due to climate change. The impacts are diverse and
far-reaching, with alterations in weather patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather
events such as erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, and intense monsoons. These changes disrupt
agriculture, exacerbate water scarcity, and increase the risks of landslides and flooding, particularly
in mountainous regions (World Bank, 2022). Additionally, the accelerated melting of Himalayan
glaciers, which are crucial for freshwater supply, poses severe threats, including the heightened risk
of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that endanger downstream communities (Agrawala et al.,
2023). Moreover, shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns are adversely affecting ecosystems
and biodiversity, leading to habitat loss and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases (World
Bank, 2022).
The socio-economic impacts of climate change in Nepal are equally concerning, particularly for
vulnerable populations in remote areas. Declining agricultural productivity threatens food security
and livelihoods, while sectors like tourism and hydropower face uncertainties due to the changing
climate (Sapkota, 2016). Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that
integrates adaptation and mitigation measures into national policies. Investing in climate-smart
agriculture, sustainable water management, disaster risk reduction, and renewable energy is vital
for safeguarding livelihoods and promoting sustainable development. International cooperation is
crucial for Nepal to access the necessary resources and technologies to effectively combat climate
change and build a resilient and sustainable future (Dahal, 2010; Climate Action, 2023).
Government Action on Climate Change
Nepal has undertaken several strategic initiatives to combat climate change and mitigate its impacts,
recognizing the critical need to protect its people and ecosystems. The National Climate Change
Policy (2011) provides a comprehensive framework for integrating climate considerations into
national planning, focusing on resilience and sustainable development. Complementing this, the
National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) identifies priority sectors such as agriculture,
water resources, health, and infrastructure, outlining urgent adaptation measures. The Climate
Change Budget Code (CCBC) was introduced to ensure that climate change considerations are
| 23
embedded in the national budget, enhancing transparency and accountability in funding climaterelated activities.
In addition to these policy frameworks, Nepal has prioritized the promotion of renewable energy,
with programs encouraging investment in hydropower, solar, and wind energy to reduce fossil fuel
dependence and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The government has also emphasized communitybased adaptation initiatives, empowering local communities to implement tailored solutions, such
as watershed management and disaster preparedness, to build resilience. On the international front,
Nepal actively engages in global climate initiatives and partnerships, participating in agreements
like the UNFCCC to access technical expertise, financial resources, and capacity-building support
essential for effective climate action..
Overall, Nepal's government has demonstrated a commitment to addressing climate change through
policy formulation, institutional frameworks, and on-the-ground initiatives aimed at enhancing
resilience, promoting sustainable development, and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. However,
significant challenges remain, including limited resources, institutional capacity constraints, and the
need for enhanced coordination and collaboration across sectors and stakeholders to effectively
tackle the complex and evolving impacts of climate change (Lamsal et al., 2014).
2. Literature Review
The conclusion drawn by Shrestha and Aryal (2011) underscores the complex interplay between
climate change and its impact on water resources in the Himalayan region. While temperature trends
align with climate model projections, precipitation variability remains inconclusive. Nevertheless, the
observed rapid deglaciation poses a significant threat to water resources, particularly affecting river
flow and runoff patterns crucial for Nepal and India. Despite inconsistencies in model predictions,
the imperative for comprehensive hydrological modeling to anticipate future runoff changes is
emphasized, alongside the need for vulnerability assessments nd adaptation plans to mitigate risks,
particularly concerning glacial lake outburst floods. As river flow data analysis reveals no consistent
trends presently, a cautious approach is advocated, urging proactive measures and preparation for
potential adverse consequences of ongoing deglaciation and climate change.
Lamsal et al. (2014) offer valuable insights into the climate change policy landscape in Nepal.
Through an analysis of challenges, opportunities, and imperatives, the authors provide a
comprehensive overview of Nepal's response to climate change. The literature review likely delves
into the unique vulnerabilities of Nepal to climate change, considering its geographical diversity,

The study by Sapkota (2016) shows the multifaceted nature of climate change, elucidating its
origins in both natural phenomena and anthropogenic activities. While acknowledging the historical
context of temperature increases and future projections, the review underscores the disproportionate
vulnerability of Nepal despite its minimal contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. With
a focus on the country's reliance on agriculture and hydroelectricity, compounded by its fragile
ecosystem and uneven topography, the review emphasizes the diverse sectors at risk and the potential
for cascading economic impacts. Moreover, the scarcity of research in the Hindukush Himalaya
region, coupled with the urgent need for adaptation funding, underscores the critical importance
of the study's intended investigation into Nepal's climate change impacts. Through secondary data
analysis, the review sets the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the challenges ahead,
emphasizing the interconnectedness between climate change, socio-economic factors, and Nepal's

Bhattacharjee et al. (2017) highlight a significant scarcity of studies documenting the biological
impacts of climate change in the Himalayan region, particularly in Nepal. Only 15% of the
reviewed articles addressed this issue, which may be an underestimation due to potential omissions,
especially from gray literature sources. Nonetheless, these studies serve as a foundational baseline
for understanding the biodiversity effects of climate change in the region. The focus primarily
lies on predicting range shifts and alterations in species distributions, highlighting the necessity
for more focused research on individual organisms and populations to elucidate their interactions
with the changing environment. Such studies, including those examining physiological thresholds
and evolutionary responses, are crucial for predicting and mitigating the potential ecological
consequences of climate change, particularly concerning invasive species like Parthenium
hysterophorus and Lantana camara in Nepal. Addressing these observational gaps presents an
opportunity for substantial and imperative research into the organism-level impacts of climate
change on biodiversity in the Himalayan region.
Shrestha, et al. (2019) claimed that research integrating instrumental climate data with societal
perspectives in the Himalayan region is limited. This study analyzed nationally representative
data from Nepal (n = 5060) to assess local perceptions of climate change alongside instrumental
climate trends. While instrumental evidence revealed consistent warming and precipitation patterns,
locals accurately perceived temperature shifts but not precipitation changes. The article suggests
that increased exposure to weather variations may enhance individuals' ability to detect climate
change over time. By integrating community perceptions with climate data, this study provides
methodological insights and supports the formulation of policies to mitigate climate risks and
enhance adaptation strategies. Results from this study suggest that, improving climate communication
between the public and scientists can enhance predictive accuracy over time, suggesting ongoing
evaluation and capacity building are vital for effective adaptation to climate change.
Rai (2019) highlighted significant shifts in precipitation patterns and agricultural practices in the
eastern development region, particularly in Khotang district. Over the period of 1960 to 2009, the

| 25
in the development region as a whole but a notable decrease in Khotang district. These changes
have impacted both snow-fed and rain-fed river systems, with increasing trends in annual mean
discharge observed in the Dudhkoshi River but decreasing trends in the rain-fed Shabhaya Khola.
Concurrently, local communities have reported a variety of alterations in rainfall patterns, including
reduced intensity and frequency of rainfall, diminished winter precipitation, and changes in
snowfall, dew, fog, and hailstorm occurrences. These changes have significantly affected agricultural
productivity, water availability, and fodder production, leading to adaptations such as shifts in
cropping timings, adoption of drought-resistant seed varieties, and changes in cultivated crops to
mitigate risks associated with climate variability. However, challenges such as soil degradation,
inadequate farming inputs, and wildlife interference persist, necessitating ongoing adaptation efforts
in the face of a changing environment.
The study by Dahal et al. (2020) delves into the assessment of future water availability in the Karnali
River Basin of the Nepal Himalaya using the SWAT hydrological model, offering crucial insights into
