CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON NEPALESE AGRICULTURE
G. Malla (Msc)14
ABSTRACT

Exponential growth of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is causing climate
change. It affects agriculture, forestry, human health, biodiversity, snow coverand aquatic
to mountain ecosystems. Changes in climatic factors like temperature, solar radiation and
precipitation have potentials to influence crop production. Despite many efforts possible on
combating impacts of climate change, there are still difficulties in Nepalese agriculture.
With an average of 0.06o
C/yea, a rise in temperature from 1975 to 2006 by 1.8o
C has been
recorded in the country. Problem of frequent drought, severe floods, landslides and mixed
type of effects in agricultural crops have been experienced in Nepal because of climate
change. Study done on CO2 enrichment technology at Khumaltar revealed that the yield of
rice and wheat increased by 26.6% and 18.4% due to double CO2, 17.1% and 8.6% due to
increase in temperature respectively. A crop simulation model (DSSAT) to study the effects
of CO2, temperature and rain in NARC showed positive effect in yield of rice and wheat in all
regions, but negative effect in maize especially in Terai. In Nepalese agriculture, the time
has come for the authorities to find out adaptive measures to mitigate the effects to reduce
untold natural calamities and miseries due to recent erratic weather pattern.
Key words: Agricultural crops, GHGs and CO2, temperature, precipitation
INTRODUCTION
Climate change
Climate change is a phenomenon due to emissions of greenhouse gases from fuel combustion,
deforestation, urbanization and industrialization (Upreti, 1999) resulting variations in solar
energy, temperature and precipitation. It is a real threat to the lives in the world that largely
affects water resources, agriculture, coastal regions, freshwater habitats, vegetation and
forests, snow cover and melting and geological processes such as landslide, desertification
and floods, and has long-term affects on food security as well as in human health.

Figure 2: Trend of total precipitation (Source: Baidya and Karmacharya, 2007)
Fig.1 shows the trend of average maximum temperature in Nepal, and that warming was
higher than average in more than 12 years. Nepal’s temperature has increased by 1.8o
C during
last 32 years. In Nepal average temperature increase was recorded as 0.06o
C per year and
that in Terai and Himalayas was 0.04o
C and 0.08o
C/year respectively (Shrestha et al., 1999).
It may be due to solar radiation absorbed by glacial lakes as well as radiation absorbed by
land because of snow melting in the Himalayan region.
Fig.2 shows the trend of average rainfall in Nepal. It shows more erratic pattern of
precipitation in the country. Rainfall was recorded minimum in the year 1972, 1977, 1992 and
2005 and maximum in the year 1975, 1985 and 1998 respectively. Erratic rainfall events (i.e.
higher intensity of rains but less number of rainy days and unusual rain) with no decrease in
total amount of annual precipitation have been experienced. Such events increase possibility
of climatic extremes like irregular monsoon pattern, droughts and floods. For example, there
were rain deficit in eastern terai and western regions, normal rain in far western region and
heavy rain in the mid western region creating flood, landslide and inundation.
Greenhouse gas and agriculture
Water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and CFCs are the
major gases that play important role in the greenhouse effect. Among the GHGs CO2, CH4 and
N2O are the 3 major gases which contribute about 88% roles in global warming (IPCC, 1996).
Harrison and Aiyer noted the potential for CH4 release from rice fields as early as 1913 (Neue,
1993). Concentration of the CH4 gas in the atmosphere is presently increasing at the rate of
3% per year. It is predicted that by the year 2100 methane levels may rise by 3.0 to 4.0 ppm
that may have a significant effect on climate change. World Data Center of Greenhouse gases
reported recent global abundance of CO2, CH4 and N2O is 377.1 ppm, 1.783 ppm and 318.6
ppb respectively (World Climate News, 2006).
Study conducted at Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) at Khumaltar showed average
seasonal methane emission from rice fields was 28kg/ha/season in rain-fed condition and also
found average maximum methane emission from rice field was 49.03 kg/ha in the field
supplied with 50% nitrogen + 15 cm stubble. Minimum of 7.7 kg/ha of methane gas was found
in the control fields. Further research on the GHGs in different eco-zones is required to
quantify and verify their contribution more precisely in the agriculture (Malla, 2006). Seasonal

methane emission of Thailand and India were 49 and 45 kg/ha respectively. Lower emission in
Nepal was due to lack of irrigation facilities and minimum fertilizer application as compared
to developed countries. Highest methane emission from rice was showed 367 kg in Korea. It
may be due to maximum use of chemical fertilizer and better irrigation facilities.
Weather and agriculture
Weather is an atmospheric condition at the surface timescale from minutes to weeks and has
an important impact on agriculture (ICIMOD/ UNEP, 2007). In Nepal, more than 80 % of
precipitation occurs in the monsoon during June to September. Increase in temperature and
vents of erratic rainfall directly affect the agriculture and food supply through their effects
on crops. The production varies due to rain brought by monsoon. Agriculture is sensitive to
short-term changes in weather that affect the production of crops. Insufficient rain and
increasing temperature cause drought, whereas intense rain in short period reduces ground
water recharge by accelerating runoff and causes floods. Both the situations induce negative
effects in the agriculture. The climate change also causes disruption in normal weather
pattern changing intensity and duration of monsoon.

Impacts on Nepalese agriculture
Nepal’s economy depends on agriculture. Total area of Nepal is 147,181 km2
 divided in
mountains (35%), hills (42%) and terai (23%). A total of 3091000ha area is cultivated for
agriculture, and it accounts for 38.15% of the gross domestic product (GDP). The country is
susceptible to disasters, including flash flood, GLOF and melting snow in the mountains and
droughts and inundation in the terai.

The rising temperature and emission of CO2 to some extent is helpful in production of major
crops. For example, increase in agricultural production by enhancing photosynthetic
processes, water use efficiency, shortening physiological period and soil microbial activities.
Decrease in grain filling period due to increase in respiration process, fertilizer use
efficiencies, shift in agricultural zone, increase in insect pest population, desertification,
increase in soil erosion, evapo-transpiration and cause malnutrition in a world overflowing
with food due to reducing protein and decrease in mineral nutrients content in different crops
are negative effects. The impacts on agriculture are the decrease of productive land in some
region and increase in other region. So, it is a complex problem to the world (Pathak et al.,
2003a). Rising CO2 promotes plant growth and if the CO2 gas doubles, yields will increase by
40%. Some positive findings with increased CO2 concentration are shown in the Annex 1.
EVIDENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN NEPAL AND NEPALESE AGRICULTURE
General
• Twelve warmest years since 1975 to 2007 (eg. 2006 was the warmest year)
• Late or pre-monsoon, unusual precipitation, decreased rainy days and intense rainfall
events caused more runoff and low groundwater recharge.
• Extreme fog conditions have recently been observed in the terai regions.
• Traditional rainfalls of Jestha and Ashar (mid July) have been shifted in Shrawan and
Bhadra in Kathmandu. It has affected negatively in the paddy production.
The Journal of Agriculture and Environment Vol:.9, Jun.2008 Review Paper
. 65
• Receding snowfall and retreating of the glaciers (AX010 small glacier mountain shrinking
at alarming rate) due to increase in atmospheric temperature in mountain environment.
• KTM valley frost day decreasing, winter cold shifted to a month later than regular and
snowfall in Kathmandu (Feb 2007, after 60 years).
• Recently Darchula district of the country faced unusual snow fall affecting collection of
precious medicinal herbs Yarsa gumba (Kantipur news may 2008)
• Mosquito from Terai and Mid-hill being able to survive in high- hills (Ilam, Mustang and
Helambu area)
AGRICULTURE
• Eastern Terai faced rain deficit in the year 2005/06 by early monsoon and crop production
reduced by 12.5% on national basis. Nearly 10% of agri- land were left fallow due to rain
deficit but mid western Terai faced heavy rain with floods, which reduced production by
30% in the year (Regmi, 2007).
• Early Maturity of the crops due to increase in temperature may help to have more crops in
the same crop cycle (NARC annual report).
• Shifting of climatic zones has been observed in the country. Extinction of natural
vegetation: local basmati rice varieties, some local wheat, maize and other agricultural
crops was also observed.
• Cold wave in Nepal in 1997/98 had negative impacts on agricultural productivity and
showed reduction in the production of crops by 27.8, 36.5, 11.2, 30, 37.6 and 38 % in
potato, toria, sarson, rayo, lentil and chickpea respectively (Source: NARC annual reports
from 1987/88 to 1997/98,).
OBJECTIVES
• To introduce the concept of climate change and its impacts in agriculture
• To help policy makers in formulating strategies on climate change and its consequences
IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND AGRO-ECO-ZONES
Nepal has various types of agricultural zones like plains, hills, mid hills, high hills and
mountains. Changes in agri-zones lead to the change in cropping pattern of the zone. Climatic
parameters have potential impact to change the ecological distribution of agricultural crops.
If shifting of climatic zones occurred rapidly due to climate change, extinction of biodiversity
might be severe. Effects are mainly on cold-water fish, herbs, pasturelands, tree lines (apple
trees) and livestock (Chauri). Increase in temperature cause more damage on agricultural
sectors in Terai region and will be more favorable to agriculture in the hills and mountains. As
temperature increases, cropping pattern as well as vector born disease of human and
livestock’s can be expected to shift in higher eco zones too. Some lands, which are presently
undesirable due to different weather factors, may be desirable in near future. For example:
maize, chilly, tomato and cucumber are now being adopted in Mustang district of the country.
Soil fertility and water availability
As a natural fertilizer, more food can be grown with increasing CO2. Increase in vigorous
growth of food crops due to more availability of CO2 may reduce the nutrients available in
soil. Increase in temperature may lead to reduce the level of soil organic carbon, soil

micronutrients and enhance decomposition by activating the microbial population in the soil
(Malla, 2003). Koshi, Narayani, Karnali and Mahakali are four major rivers flowing from the
Himalayas, and are the main source of water of the country. Agricultural sectors: mainly
crops, livestock's and horticulture largely depend on the given water sources in the country.
Variability in climate and weather is major reason for change in moisture availability in the
soil. The rapid evapo-transpiration due to increase in temperature, will demand more water
to reduce drought. Water availability governs the physiological active period and crop
production. Research showed evapo-transpiration and evaporation were also disturbed by
+2o
C and +4o
C monthly temperature rise (Fennessey, 1994). Probable vulnerabilities due to
increase in atmospheric temperature are decrease in watertable, increase in evapotranspiration, soil erosion, landslides, floods, inundation of standing crops and reduction of
soil fertility.
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON MAJOR CROPS AND LIVESTOCK
Rice

Rice is the second important crop in the world with production of about 525 million tons from
about 148 million hectors. It is cultivated within an altitude of 300-2300 meter above sea
level. In south Asia, rice production has to be doubled by the year 2020 (IRRI, 2000). Study on
increased CO2 and temperature in NARC at Khumaltar shows the increase of rice yield by
17.07 and 26.58% even at the increase in temperature in chamber by 6.2o
C and 7.36o
C (Annex
2 and 3). Greenhouse effect due to doubling carbon dioxide was observed by 1.16o
C and
produced 9.51% higher than ambient plots. Nitrogen content of the rice was increased by
16.3% due to rise in temperature, but decreased by 9.8% due to doubling of CO2. Panicle
initiation, flowering, heading, milking stage and crop maturity period has decreased by
7,4,4,4, and 6 days respectively due to the increase in temperature.
Crop simulation modeling "Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer" (DSSAT) was
used with CO2, temperature and rain as climatic parameters to study impact of climate
change in rice, wheat and maize in NARC and showed that the rice yield increased under
elevated CO2 in the terai, hills and mountains initially. But it dropped to 3.4 % in the terai,
and continued to increase by 17.9% in the hills and by 36.1% in the mountains, when the
temperature was increased by 4o
C (Fig 3).

Wheat
Wheat is the first important crop in world and third in Nepal. It occupies 20% of total cereal
area and contributes 18.8% of the total cereal production in the country. Climatic parameters
like rain and temperature strongly affect the growth and productivity of wheat. An
experiment conducted in Open Top Chamber at Khumaltar shows the increase of wheat yield
by 8.63 and 9.74 % even at the increase of the temperature by 6.94o
C and the doubling of CO2
(Annex 4 and 5). Greenhouse effect due to doubling of CO2 was observed only by 0.18o
C and
produced 9.74% higher than ambient plots. Physiological growth stages like panicle initiation,
heading, flowering, milking and physiological maturity decreased by 14, 5, 9, 6 and 14 days
respectively due to increase in temperature. Increase in the CO2 level in the C3 pathway in
rice and wheat helped to increase the production.
Wheat production was increased by 41.5 % in the Terai plain, 24.4 % in the hill and 21.2 % in
the mountain under the elevated CO2. The yield however decreased by 1.8% in the Terai but
continued to increase by 5.3 % in the hill and 33.3 % in the mountain at 4o
C rise in
temperature under irrigated condition (fig.3).The study conducted in India showed that, in
subtropical region there will be small decrease in potential yield by 1.5-5.8% but in tropical
zone the decrease will be 17-18% (Agrawal and Kalra, 1994). It indicates that rainfed wheat
productivity is likely to suffer more in Terai as compared to the mid-hill’s environment in a
climate change scenario. The additional rains had favorable impacts on the wheat yield at all
levels of temperature rise (Sherchand et al., 2007).
Maize
Maize is second major crop in Nepal but the primary crop in the hills. Soil moisture
availability during pre-monsoon determines the planting date of maize. The relaying or mixed
cropping in the hills are common practices to ensure harvest of the crop. The millet and
soybean is widely relayed at mid-altitude whereas groundnut and beans are also used as relay
crops for maize. Being a C4 photosynthetic pathway plant, its grain productivity is less
responsive to impacts of increase in atmospheric CO2 level. Maize production was increased
by 9.0% in the terai, 4.9% in the hills and 15.5% in the mountains. However, the yield
continued to decline by 26.4 % in the terai, by -9.3% in the hills but increased to 26.8% in the
mountains at 4o
 temperature rise. Thus, the response of temperature to maize crop is more
favorable in the mountains than in the terai and hills.
Horticultural crops
Fruits and vegetables are grown in 255 thousand hectares. Climate change effects on
horticultural crops are speedily becoming issues in the present situation. Tropical fruits
(banana, mango, papaya) and other crop like (croton) has been adopted in mid hills and
observed off-season flowering in high altitudes crops like peach, pear and apple. Open top
chamber was used to study the response of temperature and CO2 in tomato and showed that
tomato production increased by 279% and fruit number by 205 % in increased CO2 as compared
to field condition (Annex 6).
Some researches conducted in other countries has shown doubling of CO2 in potato decreased
the elements content like iron, zinc, manganese and sulphur. In soybean seed Oleic acid
concentration increased with increase in temperature whereas linolenic acid decreased
(Thomas et al., 2003). Also researches showed complex results e.g. in strawberries ascorbic
The Journal of Agriculture and Environment Vol:.9, Jun.2008 Review Paper
. 68
acid and glutathione increased by 13 and 171 percent from ambient to ambient + 600 ppm
CO2 condition (Agriculture Research Service). Etween, 1993 found 14 per cent decline in
nitrogen content of seeds compared with plants grown in ambient air (Curtis). Seventy-five
percent increase in air CO2 content increased sourness in orange. Vitamin C (antioxidant) was
increased approximately by 5 percent due to increase in carbon dioxide gas (Kimball and
Mitchell, 1981). Increase in CO2 in atmosphere makes positive impacts in the amount of
essential vitamins in fruits and vegetables that help to improve the human health.
Pests and diseases
Climate change parameters: temperature, rainfall pattern and humidity have an impact on
the development and distribution of pests and diseases. Increase in temperature and CO2 will
lead to an increase in population of pests and severity of diseases in presence of host plant. It
increases the rate of reproductive cycle of insect and pest. The increase in insect population
leads to demand for more use of pesticide, which unknowingly causes lots of harm to
ecosystem as well as human society. Incidence of pest and diseases would be most severe in
tropical region due to climate change. Pest and disease of plain ecosystem may gradually shift
to hills and mountains. Some pathogens of important crops from Terai zones has adapted in
hills and mid-hills (eg. rust and foliar blight) that may adversely affect the agricultural
production.
Livestock
Livestock is a major component of agriculture. It includes poultry, dairy production and raring
animals such as cattle, buffaloes, sheeps, goats and pigs. It is the major contributor of
methane mainly from ruminant animals. It is estimated to be around 365.78Gg from 19.4
million animals in Nepal. Meat and milk products are perishable goods, which require more
energy to conserve the products. It is highly sensitive to fluctuation of atmospheric
temperature. Increase in temperature by 2o
C would decrease the meat and milk quality,
hatchability of poultry and increases the possibility of disease in the livestock. Thus, it
increases the probability of vector born diseases in the human society. On the other hand,
increase of atmospheric CO2 will increase the greenery of the land or fodder and pasture for
the livestock's. Increase in amount of green fodder helps to boost up meat and milk
production. It will ultimately help in improvement of economic status of Nepalese livestock
farmers. However, if CO2 is increases rapidly, all the living creatures have to suffer from
various impacts like diseases and other problems.
RESEARCH POTENTIALS OF NEPALESE AGRICULTURE TO ADAPT IN THE CHANGING CLIMATE
• Improvement of heat, drought and pest resistant crops
• Improvement in resources for irrigation efficiencies: drip and sprinkler irrigation
• Research in water and nutrient management in various agro-ecologies to meet the climate
change
• Research in green manuring crops, cover crops, to preserve soil moisture, soil organic
matter and micronutrients
• Research on climate prediction related models and their application.
• Research works on new technologies towards low carbon economy.
• Research on land use planning, watershed management, vulnerability assessment and
resource management.
• Research on yield gap analysis to analyze the factors responsible to climate change

STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONS
• Promote seminar, workshops, training and general education to rural population
dependent on agriculture.
• Identification of present issues of climate change related to agricultural sectors.
• Strengthen Agricultural Research Station and commodity program to run effective
researches related to climate change.
• Interactive communication for transfer technologies to farmers about climate change and
its impacts on agriculture
• Preservation of genetic materials to reduce extinction of biodiversity
• Crop insurances for social securities and food securities
• Change in national policies towards farmers incentives such as subsidy in agricultural
inputs and agricultural investment
 RECOMMENDATIONS
The following important recommendations should get priority in policy:
• Develop irrigation infrastructure for reducing drought hazards.
• Develop minimum tillage and zero tillage in the rice, wheat and maize to reduce carbon
and water loss from soil.
• Develop heat, drought resistant verities/breeds, insect pest resistant varieties and
increase mechanism of IPM (integrated pest management)
• Develop safe agrochemicals to minimize pest and disease damage in the crops.
• Develop cooperation and coordination with neighboring country to cope with
vulnerabilities.
• Develop climate-forecasting system for reducing hazards.
CONCLUSION
Climate change is real and underway, so there is a need of impact identification and adoption
to cope with vulnerabilities in agricultural sector. Nepal being a least developed country, it is
moving towards vulnerable situation due to climate change. As it is known, its effects cannot
be completely controlled but effective planning and change in human habit towards a low
carbon economy can slower down possible disasters. Enriched CO2 has shown positive impact
on yield of major crops in all geographical zones. However, some research findings from other
countries showed reduction in grain and food quality. Increase in temperature and CO2 levels
is also threatening to bring hidden-hunger problem in human by lowering essential nutrients
contents in food crops. It is concluded that overall impact of climate change in agricultural
sectors will have negative impacts in the long run.
